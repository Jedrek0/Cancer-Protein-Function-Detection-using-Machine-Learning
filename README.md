Proteins, the atomic workhorses inside cells, play a central part in keeping up cellular capacities and
homeostasis. Variations in protein work are frequently embroiled within the onset and movement of cancer.
Conventional strategies for considering protein capacities are time-consuming and labor-intensive, inciting the
need for inventive approaches. Machine learning, with its capacity to analyze tremendous and perplexing
datasets, has ended up instrumental in quickening our understanding of cancer science. Application of machine
learning in cancer protein work location holds a gigantic guarantee. It empowers the recognizable proof of
particular proteins or protein combinations that will serve as biomarkers for early cancer location, forecast, and
personalized treatment methodologies. By bridging the crevice between computational sciences and oncology,
we contribute to the progressing endeavors in progressing our understanding of cancer science and cultivating
the improvement of inventive and focused on helpful mediations.  Our machine learning project has successfully demonstrated the potential of leveraging
protein function detection for cancer. The results obtained are promising, and the insights gained
provide a solid foundation for future work. Through continuous iteration and refinement, we aim to
develop a model that not only addresses the current challenges but also remains adaptable to
evolving demands in the field of machine learning.
